# 🔧 Remaining Fixes & Improvements

## Issues to Fix:

### 1. ✅ PDF Page Counting (FIXED)
**Problem:** 68-page PDF showing as 10 pages
**Solution:** Updated to use pdfjs-dist library for accurate counting
**Action:** Run `npm install pdfjs-dist` in frontend folder

### 2. 📁 Document Storage & Vendor Access
**Current:** Files uploaded but not stored permanently
**Needed:**
- Store files in Supabase Storage
- Create vendor dashboard/portal
- Allow vendors to download files
- Track which files belong to which order

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Backend: Save file path to database
// Frontend: Upload to Supabase Storage
// Vendor Portal: List orders and download files
```

### 3. 🔄 Auto-Update Dashboard After Payment
**Current:** Dashboard doesn't refresh after payment
**Needed:**
- After successful payment, update project status
- Automatically refresh dashboard
- Show updated project in list

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// In Payment.jsx after successful payment:
1. Update project status to 'accepted'
2. Navigate to dashboard
3. Dashboard auto-loads projects from backend
```
