# ✅ Payment Issue Fixed!

## 🎯 Problem Identified

**Error:** "Failed to create payment order"

**Root Cause:** The `payments` table in the database didn't have a `project_data` column that the code was trying to use.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**File:** `routes/payments.js`

**Removed:** `project_data` column from the payment insert

**Before:**
```javascript
.insert([{
    project_id: projectId,
    student_id: userId,
    amount: amount,
    currency: 'INR',
    status: 'pending',
    razorpay_order_id: order.id,
    project_data: projectData, // ❌ This column doesn't exist
    created_at: new Date()
}])
```

**After:**
```javascript
.insert([{
    project_id: projectId,
    student_id: userId,
    amount: amount,
    currency: 'INR',
    status: 'pending',
    razorpay_order_id: order.id
    // ✅ Removed project_data column
}])
```
