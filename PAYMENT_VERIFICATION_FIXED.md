# ✅ Payment Verification Fixed!

## 🎯 Problem Identified

**Error:** "⚠️ Payment received but verification failed. Please contact support."

**Root Cause:** 
- Payment was successful in Razorpay
- Backend couldn't save project because it was looking for `project_data` in payment record
- `project_data` column was removed earlier to fix order creation
- Verification failed because project couldn't be saved

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Frontend Updated:**
   - Now sends `projectData` during payment verification
   - Includes all project details (title, pages, copies, etc.)

2. **Backend Updated:**
   - Accepts `projectData` from verification request
   - Uses request data instead of payment record
   - Removed non-existent `updated_at` field

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### **Frontend (Payment.jsx):**

**Added projectData to verification request:**
```javascript
body: JSON.stringify({
  razorpay_order_id: response.razorpay_order_id,
  razorpay_payment_id: response.razorpay_payment_id,
  razorpay_signature: response.razorpay_signature,
  projectId: project.id,
  projectData: {  // ✅ Added this
    title: project.title,
    pages: paymentDetails.pages,
    copies: paymentDetails.copies,
    printType: paymentDetails.printType,
    paperType: paymentDetails.paperType,
    bindingType: paymentDetails.bindingType,
    bindingColor: paymentDetails.bindingColor,
    deliveryAddress: paymentDetails.deliveryAddress,
    deliveryCollege: paymentDetails.deliveryCollege
  }
})
```

### **Backend (routes/payments.js):**

**Changed from:**
```javascript
title: payment.project_data.title,  // ❌ Doesn't exist
```

**Changed to:**
```javascript
title: projectData.title,  // ✅ From request
```

## ✅ Backend Restarted
